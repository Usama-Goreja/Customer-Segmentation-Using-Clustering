# 📊 Customer Segmentation using K-Means Clustering

This project demonstrates how to perform **customer segmentation** using the **K-Means clustering algorithm** in Python. By clustering customers based on their **annual income** and **spending score**, businesses can better target and tailor their marketing strategies.

## 📂 Project Overview

This project involves:
- Loading and exploring the **Mall Customers dataset**.
- Performing **exploratory data analysis (EDA)**.
- Applying **K-Means clustering**.
- Using the **Elbow Method** to determine the optimal number of clusters.
- Visualizing the resulting customer segments.

## 📁 Dataset

The dataset used in this project is `Mall_Customers.csv`, containing the following features:
- `CustomerID`
- `Gender`
- `Age`
- `Annual Income (k$)`
- `Spending Score (1-100)`

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- scikit-learn

## 📈 Results

The final clustering results are visualized in a scatter plot, clearly showing distinct customer segments based on **Annual Income** and **Spending Score**.
